Data Type,Source API / Simulation,Key Purpose in App
Historical Climate Data,Open-Meteo ERA5 Reanalysis (Public),"Provides daily values for Temperature, Precipitation, Wind Speed, and Solar Radiation."
Real-time Air Quality,Open-Meteo Air Quality (Public),"Provides latest hourly readings for pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO₂, O₃."
Governance/Waste/Green,Simulated/Proxy Data (based on urban Indian trends),"Data for MSW TPD, Swachh Ranks, EV adoption, and tree inventory are simulated for demonstration purposes."Metric,Unit / Scale,Desired Direction,Contextual Thresholds / Rules
PM2.5,μg/m3,LOWER (Clean Air),Good <50; Bad >90. Critical alert trigger is configurable around 90.
Total MSW (Tons Per Day),TPD (Tons/Day),LOWER (Less Waste),High Stress is defined as MSW TPD above 1000 (proxy). Trend forecast shows expected change (↑ or ↓).
Pollution Rank,Rank # (Lower number is better),LOWER (Better Quality),Goal is Top 30 nationally. Rank is calculated dynamically based on live PM2.5 readings compared to other municipal corps.
Mean Temperature,∘C (Daily Average),Neutral (or Lower),Temperatures >25∘C are used as a proxy for crop yield stress in simulations (Impact Story).
MAE,Same Unit as Target,LOWER (Higher Accuracy),"Measures the average magnitude of error in a forecast (e.g., 2.5∘C)."
MAPE,Percentage (%),LOWER (Higher Accuracy),"Measures the average error as a percentage (e.g., 10%)."
Feature / Tab,Definition and Context
Sustainability Score,"A composite index (0-100) calculated from five weighted inputs (Air Quality, CO₂/Capita, Renewables, Water Quality, Recycling). Higher score is better."
Score Weights,"Air Quality (28%), Renewables (24%), CO₂/Capita (18%), Water Quality (15%), Recycling Rate (15%)."
Forecasting Models,"The tab allows users to select Prophet (for seasonality), ARIMA (classical time-series), or Random Forest (ML ensemble)."
Seasonality Anomaly Tracker,A visualization (Overview Tab) showing the Year-over-Year (YoY) Change in Temperature and Precipitation. Spikes far from the baseline (zero line) indicate abnormal weather events.
River Health,"Assessed by BOD (Biochemical Oxygen Demand, pollution load) and DO (Dissolved Oxygen). Good Health requires Low BOD and High DO."
4R Model (Waste),The strategic waste management hierarchy: Reduce → Reuse → Recycle → Recover (energy).
Afforestation Goal,Tracks trees needed versus current inventory to meet the standard of 10 trees per person.
